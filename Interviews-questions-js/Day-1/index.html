    <p>Q1: Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: They both are comparison operator
    "==" convert the variable values to same type before performing comparison. This is called coercion
    "===" does not do any type of coercion and return true only if variable and data type are same.
    </pre>

    <p>Q2: What is the spread operator?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Spread Operator is used to destructured the non-primitive data type.
    It allows us to quickly copy all part of existing array or object into another array or object.
    Syntax: "{...variableName}"
    </pre>

    <p>Q3: What are the differences between var, let and const?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: These three are keyword for variable.
    var is a global type which can be assign any where and can de reinitialized and can be redeclare.
    let is a block scope it will assign once and can be reinitialized but cant be redeclare to the same variable.
    const is a block scope it will assign only nce and then it can't de redeclare or reinitialized to the same variable.
    </pre>

    <p>Q4: What is Execution Context</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: An Execution Context is an abstract environment which execute javascript code.
    If code is written in global scope then it will run under global execution context.
    If the code is written un the local/functional scope then it will run under the local execution context.
    </pre>

    <p>Q5: What is meant by first class functions?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: The function that can be assign to any variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function is known as First class function.
    </pre>

    <p>Q6: What are closures? Give an example of closure?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with the lexical environment. A closure give access to an outer
    function scope from an inner function. 
    </pre>

    <p>Q7: Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: These three are used to borrow thw function.
    call - it passes the parameter by comma separated.
    apply - it passes the parameter by by an array.
    Bind - it passes the whole function so we have to assign it to the variable and you have to call it.

    example:
    const obj1 = {
        fName : "Sam";
        lName : "johnathan"
    }

    function intro(age,place){
        console.log(`My name is ${this.fName} ${this.lName} and i am ${age} old and i am from ${place}`)
    }

    intro.call(obj1,24,India)
    intro.apply(obj1,[24,India])

    let x = intro.bind(obj1);
    x(24,India)
    </pre>

    <p>Q8: What is creation phase and execution phase?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: these two are the part of Execution Context.
    in creation phase if the variable is defined with the var keyword it will allow to global scope.
    if the variable is assign with let and const then it will allow to the block scope and for both 
    global and block the value will be undefined.
    After the creation phase it will move into Execution phase.
    where the variables get there assign value and it will execute with their original values.
    </pre>

    <p>Q9: What are objects in javascript?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Objects are key value pairs. An object is a collection of function and data.
    </pre>

    <p>Q10: What are function constructors?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: Function Constructor creates a new function object. Calling the Constructor can create function dynamically.
    It is useful when you want to create multiple similar objects with same properties and methods(eg:- Details of students,employee)
    
        function studentDetails(fName,lName,age,place){
            this.fName = fName;
            this.lName = lName;
            this.age = age;
            this.place = place
        }

        const Ram = new studentDetails("ram","Kumar",17,"Jharkhand");

        console.log(Ram)

        const Shyam = new studentDetails("Shyam","Mahotra", 18, "Uk")

        console.log(Shyam)
   
    </pre>

    <p>Q11: Explain prototypes?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: Every object in javascript has a built-in property which is called its prototype.
    In prototype we can attach methods and properties in a prototype object, which enables all the other objects to inherits these methods 
    and properties. 

    Example:-
    const Hari = {
        fName: "Hari";
        lName: "Sharma";
        Nationality: "Indian"

        showDetails = function(){
            console.log(`I am ${this.fName} ${this.lName} and i am ${this.Nationality}`)
        }
    }

    const Pari = {
        fName: "Pari"
    }

    Pari.__proto__ = Hari
    </pre>

    <p>Q12: What is prototype chain?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, 
    making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that 
    has null for its own prototype.
    </pre>

    <p>Q13: Give an example of inheritance using function constructor?</p>
    <pre>
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.gender = gender;
            this.id = id;
        };
        
        function Developer(name, age, gender, id, 
        specialization) {
        
            Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);
            this.specialization = specialization;
        }
        
        let Employee1 = new Employee("Suraj", 28, "Male", 564);
        let Developer1 = new Developer("Karishma", 31, "Female", 345,
            "Frontend Developer");
        console.log(Employee1);
        console.log(Developer1);
    </pre>

    <p>Q14: What are callbacks?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: A callback function passed as an argument to another function. this allow a function call another function.
    </pre>

    <p>Q15: What is the use of setTimeout?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: setTimeout is an asynchronous. It execute when it certain given period is finished. 
    </pre>

    <p>Q16: What is an event loop and call stack?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: An Event loop that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it into the function execution context.
    A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in script that call multiple function
    </pre>

    <p>Q17: What are arrow functions?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript.
     It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.
    </pre>

    <p>Q18: What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Temporal Dead Zone is the period of time during which the let and const declarations cannot be accessed.
    Temporal Dead Zone starts when the code execution enters the block which contains the let or const declaration 
    and continues until the declaration has executed.
    </pre>

    <p>Q19: What is hoisting?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions,
    variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
    </pre>

    <p>Q20: What is the DOM?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
    It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
    </pre>

    <p>Q21: Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN? </p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Undefined :- when the variable is called without assigning and value.
    not defined :-  when thw variable is called without declaring.
    NaN :- NaN meant not a number. 
    </pre>

    <p>Q22: How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: There are 6 operators in js.
    Assignment, Arithmetic, Conditional , Comparison, Logical, Bitwise, and  type 
    </pre>

    <p>Q23: What are pure functions?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans:A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
    </pre>

    <p>Q24: What is callback hell?</p>
    <pre>
    Ans: Nested callback is known as Callback Hell.
    </pre>

    <p>Q25: What are promises and why do we need them?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Promises are the consumer and producer.
    It helps to prevent callback hell and it also help to work with API's.
    Promises are also used to handle all the asynchronous tasks.
    </pre>

    <p>Q26: What is promise chaining?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: Nested promises are known as promise chaining.
    </pre>

    <p>Q27: Give an example of async/await?</p>

    <pre>
    Ans: async function func1(){
         let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject){
              resolve("i am inside async await function");
         })
    
         let res = await promise
    
         console.log(res);
    }
    
    func1()
